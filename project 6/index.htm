        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_player">A football player or footballer is a sportsperson who plays one of the different types of football. The main types of
        football are association football, American football, Canadian football, Australian rules football, Gaelic football,
        rugby league, and rugby union.
        
        It has been estimated that there are 250 million association football players in the world,[1] and many play other forms
        of football.Footballers usually begin as amateurs and the best players progress to become professional players. Normally they start
        at a youth team (any local team) and from there, based on skill and talent, scouts offer contracts. Once signed, some
        learn to play better football and a few advance to the senior or professional teams.
